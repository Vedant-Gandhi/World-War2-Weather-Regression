# World-War2-Weather-Regression

This notebook uses the weather dataset collected by USA during World War 2.The goal is to find the relation between the minimum temprature and maximum temprature.
I have also carried out visualization for the data and some data cleaning to get a good understanding of that too.

I am still making many changes and new changes are highly appreciated as I am a newbie.:)
